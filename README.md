## My Portfolio 
I'm Supravat Paul, a Computer Science student with a strong curiosity for how technology can solve real-world problems. My academic interests mostly revolve around cybersecurity, technical innovations, and web development â€” areas where I enjoy blending logic with creativity.

This is my first project in github to show my portfolio to everyone with responsive portfolio site, smooth animations and project showcase.
